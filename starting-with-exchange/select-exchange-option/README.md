**EXCHANGE OPTION** – one of four options should be selected base on the type of exchange process:

|  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| Exchange using new fare quote | This option is mostly used for recalculation of the modified itinerary. The calculation is done by Galileo pricing system based on the entry created by TCP according to agent’s instructions. |
| Exchange using stored fare quote | Filed Fare already stored by the agent in PNR can be used for the exchange in TCP. **This option cannot be used for reissue after departure, when already flown segments are still shown in active part of PNR. Otherwise the new ticket will not be reissued correctly!!!** |
| Involuntary changes | This option can be used for any schedule changes or involuntary rerouting. No **recalculation is done, but all ticketing** data are copied from the original ticket. |
| Manual mask | There is the possibility to create manual mask and to enter all ticketing data manually without knowing cryptic entries. |

The agent should select one option to determine the way of exchange procedure.
