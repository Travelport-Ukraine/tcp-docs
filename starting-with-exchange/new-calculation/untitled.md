# Comparison table

Comparison table consists of three parts \(Taxes, Fare and Total\)

| Sections | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Taxes** | Originally paid taxes \(ticket column\) are compared with the new taxes calculated by the system \(Fare Quote column\) and the positive difference is shown in the “ADC” column.  If due to some specific reason you don’t want to collect tax difference, it is possible to switch off the bulb in “Collect ADC” and the tax difference will not be calculated, but such a decision is always the agent responsibility.  The negative tax difference is not refunded automatically, but it is possible to return the unused tax, or the residual value of the tax already paid by switching on the relevant bulb in the “Do refund” column. |
| **Add FQ tax button** | It is possible to add some tax which is not returned by the system automatically or is calculated in lower level - see the example below in this chapter. |
| **Add ticket tax button** | Is reserved for future use. |
| **Fare** | Originally paid Fare \(ticket column\) is compared with the new Fare calculated by the system \(Fare Quote column\) and the positive difference is shown in the “ADC” column. The negative Fare difference is not refunded automatically, but it is possible to return the residual value by switching on the relevant bulb in the “Do refund” column. Such a decision is always the agent responsibility and the appropriate Fare rule, category 16 must be always checked before |
| **Total** | Ticket Additional collection = tax plus Fare ADC / Refundable balance = tax plus Fare refund. |
| **EMD Penalty Additional collection** | Penalty collected on EMD. |
