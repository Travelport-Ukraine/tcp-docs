# How TCP is working

## Under the hood

TCP emulates into agency PCC under SVCB 64UZ and automates ticket issuance and subsequent exchange.

The list of PCCs available for emulation can be viewed in TCP Settings, also you can add extra PCCs here. Please refer to section [Add PCC to TCP account](../settings/add-pcc-to-tcp-account.md) for further details.

By default TCP automates ticket exchange in the PCC where ticket was originally issued.
