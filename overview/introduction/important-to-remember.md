# Important to remember

* The revised **itinerary must be booked to the corresponding booking classes**. TCP is not using “Best Buy” \(FQBB\) transaction.
* **Filed Fare** has to be stored for each passenger separately. TCP has the ability to copy the data from already created Filed Fare for the first passenger to the masks for other passengers having the same Fare and PTC \(passenger type code\) in order for the agent not to repeat the process for each passenger separately. 
* The **PNR** in Galileo system \(Smartpoint/Desktop\) **can be closed** as TCP is totally independent on the system.
* New **endorsement** message, if filed with the Fare, is automatically stored and the agent can modify it or add the important notice. Each message can be separated by dash \(-\) .
* In case of reissue of **partly used ticket** \(after departure\) all segments including those already flown must be marked in order the ticket to be recalculated from the origin.
* The **exchange/reissue of IT tickets** – the original Fare and/or Equivalent has to be entered manually by the agent because TCP cannot read the Fare and/or Equivalent from the original ticket.
* **Taxes** – unused taxes can be refunded or used for compensation of the Fare difference. New taxes or additionally paid taxes must be paid every time and cannot be compensated by unused taxes or residual Fare value. The agents can decide, if unused taxes will be refunded or not.
