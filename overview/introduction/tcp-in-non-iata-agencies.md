# TCP in non IATA agencies

TCP can be also used by non IATA agencies in case that the agency has **selective access** with an IATA agency – agreement 34 – on both sides and can display e-ticket.

Non IATA agency can calculate new ticket and prepare and store Filed fare and Exchange masks in PNR. IATA agency can only open the PNR and complete the exchange process using &gt;TKP&lt; entry.
