# Settings

TCP Settings section allows to add PCCs to your TCP account and access printer devices used ticket issuance via TCP.

For user newly registered in TCP, where no PCC has been added yet, Settings page does not display Printer settings. Printer settings section is visible only after at least one PCC has been successfully added to TCP account. 

For more information see further subsections:

* [Add PCC to TCP account](add-pcc-to-tcp-account.md)
* [Printer settings](printer-settings.md)

Please remember to check printer settings for each PCC separately, check out [How to switch between PCCs](../how-to-switch-between-pccs.md) section to get a better overview.
