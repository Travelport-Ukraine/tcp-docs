# Settings

TCP Settings section allows to add PCCs to your TCP account and access printer devices used ticket issuance via TCP.

For user newly registered in TCP, where no PCC has been added yet, Settings page does not display Printer settings. Printer settings section is visible only after at least one PCC has been successfully added to TCP account.
