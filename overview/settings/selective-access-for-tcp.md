# Why do I need bridging with PCC 64UZ

TCP uses emulation access method. Basically this means that you need to allow PCC 64UZ to emulate your PCC, that will be used in TCP workflow. For this reason you need to add 64UZ to your PCC AAT table.

Therefore you will need to submit the relevant [application form](https://ask.travelport.com/resources/sites/KB/content/live/ANSWERS/16000/AN16072/en_US/RequestForOperatorsServiceBureauAccessChangesForm%20v3_AN16072.docx) to your local Travelport representative.
