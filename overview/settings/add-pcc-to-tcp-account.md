# Add PCC to TCP account

TCP provisioning is very easy, you would simply need to add PCC 64UZ to the SVCB field in AAT profile of your PCC. Please contact your local Travelport representative for further instructions regarding addition of 64UZ to your PCC. Refer to the next sub-section to learn [why you need to set up PCC bridging with 64UZ](selective-access-for-tcp.md).

1. Once 64UZ has been added to your PCCs SVCB fields, go ahead and follow the guidelines indicated in TCP Settings Section.

2.Please note that you would need to create new PNR in your PCC which you want to be added into TCP. This is just a security check to confirm that you are entitled to create and process reservations in this PCC.

3. The surname and name for reservation need to be indicated in PNR in exactly the same way as in TCP Settings section, without title. The surname and name is changed after each page reload.
