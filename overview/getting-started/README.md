# Getting started

To benefit from TCP usage you should:

1. place your order online via TCP website.
2. once you received from us the access credentials, please add your PCC to your TCP account as instructed in [TCP Settings](https://omega.travelcloudpro.eu/#/settings). For more information, please check subsection [Add PCC to TCP account](../settings/add-pcc-to-tcp-account.md). Please note that you would need Selective access established and 64UZ already added to the SVCB field in AAT profile of your PCC. Check out the latest procedure via ASK Travelport [AN16072](https://goo.gl/A4PUc4). Please contact your local Travelport representative for further details.
