# Getting started

To benefit from TCP usage you should follow three basic steps:

1. Add our PCC 64UZ to the SVCB field in AAT table of the agency PCC that will be using TCP Exchange. This is a technical requirement for the solution to work. Please contact your local Travelport representative for further details.
2. Use this registration [link](https://travelcloudpro.eu/#/register) to create account via TCP website. Step by step manual is available in section [Create account in TCP](https://app.gitbook.com/@cee-travelport/s/tcp/~/drafts/-M5MTBIiIrcsRhsOfXGU/overview/getting-started/create-account-in-tcp/~/settings/share).
3. Add your PCC into your TCP account and make appropriate settings of your account. Step by step manual is available in section [Settings](https://app.gitbook.com/@cee-travelport/s/tcp/~/drafts/-M5MTBIiIrcsRhsOfXGU/overview/settings/~/settings/share).
