{% hint style="info" %}
If there are more passengers with the same Fare and same passenger type code \(PTC\), you can store Filed Fare for one passenger only and the other passengers can be copied afterwards.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
For exchange it is necessary to open the ticket with OPEN status \(i\) and click on EXCHANGE button. You **cannot start** with Fare Quote
{% endhint %}

If the agent starts with Fare Quote anyway and clicks on “USE FOR EXCHANGE BUTTON”, a warning message will appear in the pop-up window about correct procedure for exchange.

So as explained above, it is necessary to start with the ticket, click on \(i\) and then on EXCHANGE button and use the option “Exchange using store fare quote”.

Once you click EXCHANGE option can be selected

Now you can continue as always.
