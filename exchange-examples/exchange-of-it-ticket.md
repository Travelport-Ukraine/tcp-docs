### Add missing ticket data

It is necessary to enter the Fare manually because all ticketing data are copied from the previous ticket - IT ticket, where the Fare is not shown. TCP cannot also read PFC breakdown related to FX tax because it is missing on the previous ticket. Therefore, PFC must be entered manually as well.

Now the ticket can be exchanged, new ticket and EMD for penalty issued. Or everything can be stored in PNR and issue later – then the agent will use TKP to issue new ticket and EMDI… to issue EMD for penalty.
