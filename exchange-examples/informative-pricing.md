# Informative pricing

If you would like to receive new Fare calculation for information purposes only, it is necessary to create **new segments in TCP**. Informative segment\(s\) are not stored in PNR but can be booked by TCP upon your confirmation.

Passenger would like to travel 16MAR from PRG to CDG, but he is not decided yet. He would like to know, if the Fare would be the same and only penalty to be collected. It is possible to book new segment\(s\) here in TCP and if the change is agreed by the passenger to confirm it and remove the original segment\(s\).
